<h1>Web Project 1: MVC, Javascript, Vue.js, PhP </h1>

<p>We were tasked with creating a website for a fictional client's restaurant, which included a dedicated administration section for employees. This administration section enables employees to log in and perform actions such as adding, modifying, and deleting menu items, reflecting real-time updates on the client-side menu. The emphasis was on ensuring a secure connection, employing encrypted passwords, and implementing varying levels of administrative rights for enhanced access control. </p>

<h2> Step 1 - Design </h2>

<p>Mockups had to receive client approval before progressing to step 2 of integration. The choice of the design tool was flexible, with options such as XD, Figma, Photoshop, Illustrator, and others. Mockups were required to be exported in PNG or PDF format for client review and approval. This ensured a collaborative and transparent design process, aligning the project with the client's expectations before moving forward.</p>

<h2> Step 2 - Integration </h2>

<p> The integration phase involved meticulously reproducing the final approved mockup with 100% accuracy, employing CSS, Sass, HTML, and JavaScript. The emphasis was on adhering to established standards, ensuring the seamless incorporation of design elements. Additionally, optimization for search engines and the proper utilization of tags were integral aspects of the integration process. To enhance the user experience, feedback mechanisms and thoughtfully crafted animations were incorporated, contributing to a dynamic and engaging interface. This approach not only met design specifications but also prioritized optimal performance and user satisfaction throughout the integration phase.</p>

<h2> Step 3 - Dynamization </h2>

<p>The server-side programming elements of the website were characterized by an emphasis on quality, structure, and optimization. The code was crafted to be efficient, clear, and maintain a clean structure, ensuring ease of maintenance and future development. Stability and effective error case management were prioritized to enhance the overall reliability of the server-side operations. In addition, secure SQL queries were implemented, bolstering the website's resistance to potential security threats. Passwords were treated with an extra layer of protection through encryption, underscoring the commitment to safeguarding sensitive user data. This comprehensive approach to the server-side programming contributed to a robust, secure, and high-performance foundation for the website. </p>

<h2> Step 4 - Online deployment </h2>

<p>In the final phase of the project, deployment onto a remote server was executed seamlessly by employing the combined capabilities of FileZilla and AWS. Leveraging FileZilla, a proficient FTP client, enabled the efficient transfer of project files between the local development environment and the remote server. This process ensured the swift and secure movement of data, laying the groundwork for the subsequent steps. Simultaneously, AWS, with its robust cloud infrastructure, played a pivotal role in hosting the deployed application. The utilization of AWS not only provided a scalable and reliable hosting environment but also afforded access to a suite of services optimizing performance, security, and overall operational efficiency. The harmonious integration of FileZilla and AWS marked the successful deployment of the project.</p>
